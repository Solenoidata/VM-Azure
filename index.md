Physics analyses in the field of particle physics often involve processing large amounts of data, typically spanning hundreds of gigabytes. Traditionally, these analyses have been performed using high-throughput batch systems like HTCondor, which is installed at CERN and various research institutions. Additionally, the worldwide LHC computing grid (WLCG) has been instrumental in providing distributed computing resources for such analyses. However, not everyone may have access to these resources at their own institutions. To overcome this limitation, the CMS OpenData workshop in 2023 aims to enable researchers to utilize computing resources through public cloud vendors.
