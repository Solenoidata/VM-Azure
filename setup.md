title: Setup
---

For the cloud pre-exercise we will be using [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com), here you will learn how to create a working cloud environment to run realistic physics analysis that we will later be used in this [workshop](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/2022-08-01-cms-open-data-workshop/). 

### Setup
When opening a [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) (for the first time) you will be granted $300.00 USD in credit that can be used within a lapse of 3 months. Once you've opened your account please check the [prep-work](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2022-lesson-introcloud/01-intro/index.html) episode of this lesson to get started. Alternatively you can watch an official [demo walkthrough](https://youtu.be/RPO6zR12iUc) to get familiar with the cloud environment to be used in the actual [workshop](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/2022-08-01-cms-open-data-workshop/). Don't forget to subscribe to the [Mattermost cloud pre-exercises channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodws2022/channels/cloud-pre-exercise). Good luck!
