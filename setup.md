title: Setup
---
### Welcome!
For this pre-exercise we will be using [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com), here you will learn how to create a working cloud environment to run realistic physics analysis.
### Setup
A [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) account will be required for this [workshop](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/2022-08-01-cms-open-data-workshop/) (Cloud Computing). When creating a GCP account, you can access $300.00 USD in credit that can be used within a lapse of 3 months (a credit/debit card is required for this). Keep in mind that we will temporarily provide you with the resources for the Cloud Computing Lesson so this is NOT completely necessary, since you can always use minikube to run tests.

Once you've decided what suits you best, please check the [prep-work](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2022-lesson-introcloud/01-intro/index.html) episodes of this lesson to get started. Alternatively you can watch an official [demo walkthrough](https://youtu.be/RPO6zR12iUc) to get familiar with the cloud environment to be used in the actual [workshop](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/2022-08-01-cms-open-data-workshop/). Don't forget to subscribe to the [Mattermost cloud pre-exercises channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodws2022/channels/cloud-pre-exercise). Good luck!
