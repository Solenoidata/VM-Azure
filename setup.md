For the cloud pre-exercise we will be using the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) where you will learn how to create a working cloud environment that we will be using in the workshop. 

When opening a [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) (for the first time) you will be granted a $300 USD credit to be used within a lapse of 3 months, once you've opened your account please check the [prep-work](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop2022-lesson-introcloud/01-intro/index.html) episode of this lesson to get started.

Alternatively you can watch an official [demo walkthrough](https://youtu.be/RPO6zR12iUc) to get familiar with the cloud environment to be used in the actual workshop. Don't forget to subscribe to the [Mattermost cloud pre-exercises channel]. Good luck!
